“Winning isn’t everything, it’s the only thing.”
Actually, that famous statement originated with
UCLA football coach Red Sanders... but at the end
of the day, it’s not far off from Lombardi’s philoso-
phy.

----

hierarchical or flat,
centralized or decentralized, divisional or non-divi-
sional, and everything in between. Yet it’s not struc-
ture, but results, that prove a leader’s methods.
Leadership is not a position, it’s a process that pro-
duces the desired results. If you don’t produce
results fairly, and squarely within the rules—if you
can’t execute—you are not a leader.
