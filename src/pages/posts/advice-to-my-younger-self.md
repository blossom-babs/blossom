Not general advice, just career advice

1. The discomfort is a good sign, you're about to push past another limit
2. You're not a failure for not having the same journey as everyone else. who cares about everyone else, this is your own story
3. Before you get another mentor, buy another course, ask yourself why?
4. It's okay to network, to be cringe as along as you're true to yourself
