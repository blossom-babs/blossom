Hello there.

I feel like I've been drunk on some UI implementation juice. It's all I've done since the last time I wrote (4 days) ago.

I am surprised at how much I do not know.
Astounded by how much there is to learn.
And forever humbled that I'll never know it all, no matter how hard I try.

Learning is continuous.

Today is the interview and the last day of intense grind (for now)

_Intense grind is a period of time where I do nothing except practice and repeat a subject matter. In this case, react as my interview will hopefully be in react._

So, I'll be back fully tomorrow but I interrupted by study to share this responsive goodness I discovered.

```
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));

```

The items in the grid:
- takes up a maximum of 250px where possible
- a minimum of 1fr if not enough space (smaller screen - 1fr means take available space)
- auto-fit ensures it's automatically responsive.

The joys of CSS.
