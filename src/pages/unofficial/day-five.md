Still on prototypes in javascript,

```
const newArray = []

newArray.__proto__.__proto__

```
is pretty cool but there's no point using it beyond understanding prototypal inheritance in javascript, as accessing prototype by itself can be a pretty expensive operation.

- Prototypes and prototypal inheritance in Javascript: Since everything in Javascript is essentially an object, (yes even functions are objects), understanding this basic yet totally overlooked behaviour in Javascript was absolutely crucial for me. Although I do not fully get it here, but hey is day 1 of Prototype indepth study
- Played around with some blockchain technology

Worked on a couple problems in [Great Frontend](https://www.greatfrontend.com/) where I had to use
- controlled and uncontrolled components
