**Worked on:**  **Personal Website**


I think I'm at a point where I'm happy with my personal website.

I used native web API to pass data around and since it's been a while since I've done that, I was quite excited and shared on linkedin. 

As further push, I shared the link to my website, so because I know eyeballs will get on it, I am pushing this website to a state I can be proud of. Fingers crossed I finish it tonight.
