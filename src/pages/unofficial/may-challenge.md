_Hello, may_

Another month, another challenge.

This month I'm committing to 31 days of code - any code, every day. 

No pressure for perfect projects or big builds. Just showing up and working out the dev muscle.

One line at a time.  
Let’s see where it goes.

Why is this not going in my "technical blog", because writing a full fledged technical article I'd be proud cost time and research. Writing here would hold me accountable and lighten the burden of a polished article. Most days might be bug fixes and nothing astounding anyways, but if anything noteworthy comes up, I will draft a technical article.

Ciao.
