I think I'm broken.

I can no longer code with music.

I don't recall which podcast episode or blog post sent me on the challenge of working in complete silence. I thought it would be a great exercise to pracitice being with my own thoughts, so I swapped out my headphones for silence.

Initially, it was difficult. 

And to be honest, the only reason I survived it was because
1 - As a rule, I rarely ever bring / use my phone in my workspace
2. So I used spotify mac, but then my mac as if conspiracy started to lag with multiple tabs and operations open. In a bid to reduce to workload, I had to cut out using some tab and added spotify to list (pfft, it still lagged but at least it was a means to building an habit).

Now nearly 1 year later. 

I got a new mac, and wanted to play music while I worked. We can all agree mac has the best sound system out there, anyways I decided to spin that baby around, flaunt the speakers, and enjoy my new mac (2025, M4 - no more lag!!) BUT, it felt almost painful and affected my productivity.

Of course, I can build the habit again but now I'm asking myself why?
