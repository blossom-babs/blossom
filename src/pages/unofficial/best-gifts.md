I think one of the best gifts we can give ourselves  while we exist on this side of eternity  is learning to embrace difficult things.

It is my opinion from my personal experience that -
<br>
Solving the hardest problems first stretches your mind.  
Solving the easiest ones first makes us comfortable.  
(Not always a bad thing but sometimes, it trains our brains to run from resistance.)

Then, when the real challenge comes, we panic. We retreat. We go back to the safe task we’ve already mastered.

_atleast is what I noticed with me._

But what if we did the hard thing first?

What if we didn’t try to learn *everything* at once, just the one difficult thing in front of us?  
What if we stopped waiting for difficulty to feel easy, and just got used to showing up anyway?

Anyways.

Signed,
