I think one of the best gifts we can give to ourselves while we exist on this side of eternity is to learn and embrace doing difficult things.

solving the hardest problems first stretches your mind

solving easy problems first makes us lazy (not always true), then we are faced with the hard problems, our brain rejects it and runs back to the simpler problem (we can always overcome this resistance muscle anyway)

but isn't it easier to simply do one thing at a time which is learn the skill rather than learn the skill (which no matter how easy, if new will have some level of difficulty)
