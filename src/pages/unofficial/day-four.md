Today I studied, 

- Prototypes and prototypal inheritance in Javascript: Since everything in Javascript is essentially an object, (yes even functions are objects), understanding this basic yet totally overlooked behaviour in Javascript was absolutely crucial for me. Although I do not fully get it here, but hey is day 1 of Prototype indepth study
- Played around with some blockchain technology
