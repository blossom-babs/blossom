**Hopeful.**

Job hunting hasn’t been the worst thing for me.

Sure, it’s been difficult. I’ve doubted my skills, cried in private, almost talked myself out of it entirely.  
I’ve come close to cynicism more than once.  

And yet -- it’s *still* not the worst thing I’ve experienced.

God has brought me through far worse.  
Through dirt. Through grit. Through seasons that broke me harder than a rejected job application ever could.

So now, when I feel myself unraveling, I remind myself:  
> If I lose my mind over this, maybe my resilience isn’t as deep as I thought.


#### Embracing the Failure, Seeing the Frame

I’m not just job hunting.  
I’m building resistance.  
I’m learning skills.  
I’m making connections (yes, lol).

And honestly? The glass is either half-empty or half-full. It really is about perspective.  

Job hunting is hard enough.  
I’ve decided not to add the extra weight of negativity on top.

- Failed a behavioral round? I’ll work 10x harder to craft my stories.  
- Failed a technical round? I’ll sharpen my skills twice as hard.  
- Didn’t get a callback? I’ll dive into free LinkedIn Lives and level up my networking game.  

> I either win, or I win.


#### It’s Not Just the Hustle

It’s not all struggle.  
I’ve interviewed at some *really* amazing companies.  
(Can’t wait to write about them.)

And in the meantime...

- I’ve also met incredible engineers I wouldn’t have encountered otherwise, brilliant minds, humble hearts.
- I’ve expanded my skillset at an unbelievably fast pace.
- I’ve had space to explore creatively.
- I’ve exposed blindspots I didn’t know I had.

#### A Closing Thought

I’m also incredibly aware of the **privilege** I have — to not be job hunting from a place of panic.  
I’ve been there before. It was awful. This isn’t that.

And so I’m learning to see God in everything.  
Even in this, in the silence, the suspense, and yes, even in unemployment.
