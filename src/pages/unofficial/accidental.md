I got a call from my bank yesterday about getting accidental life insurance.

Yes, this is diifferent from the regular life insurance.

Apparently, this can only be claimed by your beneficiary if you accidentally pass away (not including suicide, self-harm, drugs, alcohol and natural causes).

In the offering, if I sign up, my chosen dependant could receive up to $300,000 in the event of my accidental passing.

Suddenly, all those Western mystery thrillers I love make perfect sense.  
Of course people are “accidentally” killing folks to collect the money. Of course.

But I have a question...

What happens if I do not accidentally pass away _(which I do not plan to as a matter of fact)_, When I'm 80 and grey, but have spent my entire life contributing towards this bill, what then? 

Oh, and:  
In the case of critical injury (I’m quoting the salesman here: *“like if you lose your limbs — what?”*), you can still claim the money.  
You just need to provide strong proof that it was accidental.

Got it.
