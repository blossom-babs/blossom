I got a call from my bank yesterday about getting an accidental life insurance.

yes this is diifferent from the regular life insurance.

This can only be claimed by your beneficiary in case you accidentally pass away (no, suicide, self-harm, drugs, alcohol and natural causes nullify these).

In the offer my bank was offering, my chosen dependant will get up to $300,000 if I accidentally pass away.

Now all those Western mystery thrillers I enjoy makes sense, of course people are "accidentally" killing folks to get the money. Of course.

I have a question though, what happens if I do not accidentally pass away (which I do not plan to as a matter of fact), when I am 80 and grey, but have spent my entire life contributing towards this bill, what then? 

Oh I forgot to add that in case of critical injury (and I am quoting the salesman directly here - such as you lose your limbs, what?) Then I could get this money but of course I need to have strong proof that it is accidental.

Welcome to the Western civilization.
