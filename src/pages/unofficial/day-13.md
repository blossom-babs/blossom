My younger sister was preparing for an interview for her volunteer role, while practing the classic, "Tell me about yourself", she added how she loved to solve puzzles - which is true, she is a genius for puzzles. And -- she picked up this curiousity only recently, but she needed one strong signal - completing a really difficult puzzle - in less than a week to cement her identity as a puzzle solver.

While introducing myself at an event recently, during the icebreaker, I mentioned that I ran my first 2k recently and it got a lot of people talking.

So I learnt this, if you want to have really good stories, do really difficult things - or atleast new things till you find what you enjoy.

Life is meant to be enjoyed and experienced.

Again I probably say this from a place of privilege. But if you can, go out and experience new things, you life truly does not consist in the abundance of things you own, but from the impact and quality of your every day life.

I've signed up for my community's running club and we're gearing for the marathon, regardless of whether I succeed or fail, I would have a very good story (time and experience) because I tried something new.
