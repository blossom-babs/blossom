_'Finding joy in the small details of a new normal.'_

There’s a smart water system in my home.

Beneath the tap, there’s a red and blue label.  
Twist to the left (red), hot water.  
Twist to the right (blue), cold water.  
The center gives you lukewarm.

Not all the taps are wired the same, in the kitchen, it twists top to bottom, but there’s always the red/blue label to guide you.

And every single time… I’m amazed.  
lol.

I hope I never get too familiar and lose my wonder.  
Sure, it might be a basic amenity here, but not to me.  

It’s a new reality.  
And I’m learning to enjoy it in full color.
