There is a smart water system in my home.

Beneath the tap, there is a red and blue label, when I twist the cap to the left (red), hot water comes out, to the right (blue), I get cold water. The center is lukewarm. They are not all wired the same, for instance the tap in the kitchen is twisted top to bottom, but there's the red/blue label to guide you. 

I am amazed every single time. lol.

I hope I never get too familiar and lose my wonder. Sure it is basic bare minimum ammenity here but not to me, it's a new reality.
