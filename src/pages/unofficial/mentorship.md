I believe the right mentorship does accelerate growth. 

You still have to get those failure reps in to be successful but because you are towing the footsteps of someone who's done it before, the feedback loop is shorter.

Which brings me to my first point of making the most of mentorship:

- Find thyself. In knowing yourself, what you want, where you are, your current story and where you'd like to be, then you start to seek out kindred spirit who, having faced the same cards you've dealt with, have now become who you aspire to be.

- Ask good questions: Piggybacking off the first because if you do not know what you want "out of life", you wouldn't know the right questions to ask to get you from point A to point. And it is only by asking good questions - borne from experience and vision - that you can get the best answer from your mentor. Do not ask questions like you expect them to figure out life for you. No, you show up like Ali ready to take up the mountain but with questions on how to tackle it.

- You won't have much value to give at first and that's okay. Common advice is to "give-value-first", chances are you probably do not have much leverage starting out and that's okay. Most people are content with being a part of someone's story and growth. And if you mentor sees themselves in you (remember seeking out kindred spirit), they will recognize the similarity in your paths and will be content with helping you becoming.
