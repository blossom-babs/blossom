Another thing that amazes me is the garbage collection system, lol.

The collector that carries off food waste is different from plastic and recyclables and ...

it is amazing to me. It screams order (and job employements, lol)

I also appreciate that the area doesn't stink when they come, I only know they're here because the trucks are noisy.

Point to self: Research what makes garbage collector trucks in N/A not stink.
