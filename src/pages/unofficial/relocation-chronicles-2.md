Another thing that amazes me: the garbage collection system. ðŸ˜‚

There are different trucks for food waste, plastic, recyclablesâ€¦ and more.  
It screams order (and *job creation*, lol).

What I also appreciate? The area doesnâ€™t stink when they come by.  
I only ever notice theyâ€™re around because the trucks are loud.

**Note to self:** Research what makes North American garbage trucks not stink. Seriously.
