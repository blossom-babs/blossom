Today, I woke up at 00:55 AM to a family emergency. I and my family were awake till 10:30 AM after which we had to make quick 2-hour trip. I got back to my house at some minutes after 12:00 PM, I had a couple of meetings which I struggled to trudge through.

All these to say today was hectic.

It was tough to keep up my daily schedule but I wanted to get some study reps in, I found it hard to code/concentrate so I did something else:

- Practiced some math exercises. I studied functions and domains and used organic chemistry tutor as a secondary resource.
