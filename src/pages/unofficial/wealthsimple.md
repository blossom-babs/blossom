Wealthsimple has one of the best aesthetic-to-product-theme matches I’ve seen in a while.

You know how you walk into a hospital and immediately feel the ambience — the calm, the sterility — or how a library just *feels* quiet from the inside out? The experience matches the aesthetics.

That’s what using the Wealthsimple app is like.

The experience **feels like wealth**.  
Every time I fund my account, I want to do it again.  
It’s clean. It’s modern. It’s class.

If you live in Canada and don’t use it already, try it.
