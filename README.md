# 🌸 Blossom’s Hive

> The cozy corner of the internet where I write, build, and share a little bit of everything.

**[Visit it live → blossombab.me](https://blossombab.me)**

This is my personal website — a mix of thoughts, projects, blogs, and breadcrumbs for anyone curious about what I do and how I think. Built with care using [Astro](https://astro.build) and some of the tools I love.



## Tech Stack

- **Astro** — for fast, content-first site building
- **JavaScript**
- **CSS** (with a dash of custom styling)
- **Web APIs** — where needed, for little sparks of interactivity
